## Branch Protection Rules

To maintain the stability of the project, we have implemented the following rules:

1.  **Direct Pushes to `main` are Disabled:** You should not push directly to the `main` branch.
2.  **Pull Request Workflow:** All changes must be submitted via a Pull Request (PR).

## 🚀 How to Contribute

1.  **Create a Branch:**
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature
    ```

2.  **Make Changes:** Implement your feature or fix.

3.  **Commit:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Add awesome feature"
    ```

4.  **Push:**
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature
    ```

5.  **Open a Pull Request:** Go to the repository on GitHub and open a PR into `main`.
